	<p><code style="display: none;"> </code>War is in our DNA, and with conflict, there is injuries to our Military including loss of limbs and traumatic brain injury. <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/program/re-net-reliable-peripheral-interfaces" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> is looking to change that by enabling wounded service members with amputations to neurally control state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs. The goal is to assist them in returning to active duty and to improve their quality of life. Program developments may impact the broad community of patients with medical amputations, spinal cord injuries and neurological diseases. <code style="display: none;"> </code> <code style="display: none;"> </code>The challenges lie with creating an interface that is directly compatible with our own nervous system and making the connection fast enough to interpret our movement intent without latency. <code style="display: none;"> </code> <code style="display: none;"> </code>I have been following Lesâ€™s story (an amputee) for a while and featured it in last years 2015 version of this article, see video below and wanted to showcase it again as organizations such as Johns Hopkins are making great strides in the movement to help the world live and easier life.</p>
