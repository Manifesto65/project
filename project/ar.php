	<p><code style="display: none;"> </code>The United States typically defines someone as legally blind when the personâ€™s central vision has degraded to 20/200, or the person has lost peripheral vision so that he sees less than 20 degrees outside of central vision. Normal vision is 20/20, and people can usually see up to 90 degrees with their peripheral vision. An estimated 1.1 million people in the United States are considered legally blind. <code style="display: none;"> </code> <code style="display: none;"> </code>This has led to companies like <a href="http://www.nano-retina.com/" title="Nano-Retina">Nano-Retina</a> to develop a&nbsp;sophisticated and elegant solution intended to restore the sight of people who lost their vision due to retinal degenerative diseases. The miniature Nano Retina device, the NR600 Implant, replaces the functionality of the damaged photoreceptor cells and creates the electrical stimulation required to activate the remaining healthy retinal cells. NR600 consists of two components; a miniature implantable chip and a set of eyeglasses worn by the patient.</p>
