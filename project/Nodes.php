<p>After a five-month stay aboard the International Space Station, NASA Ames’ two Nodes satellites were deployed on May 16 from the NanoRacks platform and into low-Earth orbit to begin their much anticipated two-week technology demonstration. Nodes demonstrated the ability to receive and distribute commands in space from the ground, while periodically exchanging scientific data from their onboard radiation instruments, a first for small satellites. The satellites configured their data network autonomously by determining the best-suited of the two spacecraft to communicate with the ground each day of the mission. These demonstrations will enable a path toward new network capabilities for operating swarms of small spacecraft in the future.</p>
<p>The Nodes mission consists of two 1.5-unit (1.5U) CubeSats, each weighing approxi- mately 4.5 pounds (2 kilograms) and measuring about 4 inches x 4 inches x 6.5 inches (10 centimeters x 10 centimeters x 16 centimeters). The satellite hardware is identical to that Ames developed for the Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks (EDSN) mission (a swarm of eight satellites designed to also test satellite swarm capabilities), that was lost on November 3, 2015 in the failure of the launch vehicle that was carrying them to orbit as secondary payloads. Though the hardware for the two missions is analogous, the EDSN software capabilities were en- hanced for the Nodes mission. Nodes and EDSN continue the legacy of the Phonesat series that introduced the use of commercial Android smartphone technology to perform many of the spacecraft functions normally accomplished with expensive, customized electronics components.</p>
<p>“The Nodes mission concept was an opportunity to leverage the excellent work done on EDSN, and extend the systems at low cost and effort,” said David Korsmeyer, director of engineering at Ames. “This is the value of the small satellite model – quickly adapt to new opportunities and leverage systems for incremental missions.”</p>
<p>The Nodes satellites performed to expectation and demonstrated technology ‘firsts’ that boost the capabilities of this tiny platform. Ground stations at Santa Clara University and Ames, as well as amateur radio operators around the world, received beacon packets from the Nodes containing data on the health and operational status of each satellite. And the satellites demonstrated their planned mission objectives, including three technology ‘firsts’ for small spacecraft: commanding a spacecraft not in direct contact with the ground by crosslinking commands through a space network; crosslinking science data from one Nodes satellite to the second satellite before sending it to the ground; and autonomous reconfiguration of the space communications network using the capability of Nodes to automatically select which satellite is best suited to serve as the ground relay each day. The crosslinking ‘firsts’ are important milestones from both technical and operational perspectives as NASA continues its interest in developing constellations of small spacecraft for future high value science and exploration missions.</p>
<p>Networks of small satellites may open new horizons in astronomy, Earth observation and solar physics. Their range of applications includes multi-satellite science missions, the formation of synthetic aperture radars for Earth-sensing systems, as well as large aperture observatories for next-generation telescopes. They also can serve to collect science measurements distributed over space and time to study the Earth, the Earth’s magnetosphere, gravity field, and Earth-Sun interactions.</p>
<p>The Nodes project is sponsored by the SSTP, within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, and received additional funding from the NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
