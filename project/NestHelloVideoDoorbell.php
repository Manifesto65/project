	<p>The Nest Hello video doorbell is our favorite product of its kind. Sleek and easy to install, it allows users to keep an eye on their front door in high resolution while away from home. It will send you alerts when someone is at your door, and even recognize family members and friends. </p>
<p>You have the option to answer the door via a built-in speaker and microphone (a mobile app is required). The gadget has a wide-angle lens and night-vision capabilities. It requires a wired installation.</p>
