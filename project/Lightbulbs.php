	Hospitals are known to be potentially dangerous place with lotâ€™s of people with different elements and diseases. &nbsp;One company, <a href="http://www.indigo-clean.com/" title="Indigo-Clean">Indigo-Clean</a> has developed a technology using visible light&nbsp;that continuously disinfect the environment and bolsters your current infection prevention efforts.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2 class="boxed-content-title">How it works</h2>
	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>
		The 405nm emitted from Indigo-Clean reflects off of walls and surfaces, penetrating harmful micro-organisms
	</li>
	<li>The light targets naturally occurring molecules called porphyrins that exist inside bacteria. The light is absorbed and the excited molecules produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) inside the cell</li><li>405nm creates a chemical reaction inside the cell, similar to the effects of bleach</li><li>The Reactive Oxygen Species inactivates the bacteria, preventing it from re-populating the space</li></ol>
