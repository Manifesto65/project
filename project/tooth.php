In a collaborative study between the Georgia Institute of Technology and King’s College London, researchers looked at the cichlid fishes of Lake Malawi in Africa, who lose teeth just to have a new one slide into place. Their <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/15/1514298112.abstract" title="Study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a>, published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, identifies the genes responsible for growing new teeth&nbsp;and may lead to the secret to “tooth regeneration”&nbsp;in humans.</p><blockquote><p>“The exciting aspect of this research for understanding human tooth development and regeneration is being able to identify genes and genetic pathways that naturally direct continuous tooth and taste bud development in fish, and study these in mammals,” said the study’s co-author Paul Sharpe, a research professor from King’s College, in a <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2015-10/giot-rat101515.php" title="Press Release" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>. “The more we understand the basic biology of natural processes, the more we can utilize this for developing the next generation of clinical therapeutics: in this case how to generate biological replacement teeth.”</p></blockquote><p>Another study from a Harvard team successfully used low-powered lasers to activate stem cells and stimulate the growth of teeth in rats and human dental tissue in a lab. The results were published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine. &nbsp;Stem cells are no ordinary cells. They have the extraordinary ability to multiply and transform into many different types of cells in the body. They repair tissues by dividing continually either as a new stem cell or as a cell with a more specialized job, such as a red blood cell, a skin cell, or a muscle&nbsp;cell.

		Dentures and dental implants may soon become a thing of the past. Stem cell research is making it possible to regrow your missing teeth!<br>
This is a much-needed medical advancement, especially considering that by age <strong>74—26% of adults have lost all of their permanent teeth</strong>.</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>
